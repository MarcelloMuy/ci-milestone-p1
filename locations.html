            <h3>The Temple Bar Pub</h3>
            <p>Cool and quirky pub, popular among artists and poets. Traditional live music sessions daily. A must visit place to fully experience the best in Irish culture. A huge stock of whiskey always available and one of the largest selections in the entire world.</p>

            <h3>Molly Mallone Statue</h3>
            <p>Gorgeous statue in city centre, just at the end of Grafton Street from one side and South William Street from another side. In the back of the statue there is the stuning St.Andrew's church. If you are visiting Dublin for the very first time, this is a place to get a photo, and if the weather is nice you'll probably have a chance to listen to one of the great Dublin buskers.</p>

            <h3>Phoenix Park</h3>
            <p>The biggest urban park in Ireland. It's the home of the deer, they are very friendly and if you manage to get close enough it is a perfectly selfie opportunity. The park is located 15 minutes away from the city center and it is a very popular destination in summer time. Dublin Zoo is located there as well. Great for jogging, relaxing or for family & friends picnics.</p>

            <h3>Samuel Beckett Bridge</h3>
            <p>One of the most beautiful sections of the River Liffey situated at Dublin’s dockland district. The Samuel Beckett Bridge is designed to represent a reclined harp to represent Ireland’s national symbol. It is also a very clever engineering feet & great to watch when it opens to allow shipping to pass.</p>

The guided tour goes below deck to illuminate the terrible conditions for passengers, and the lasting effects of this catastrophic period in Ireland.</p>
