# Rickshaw Guided Tours Project

## Introduction 
Welcome to my first milestone project. This project is a website for a guided tours company that uses rickshaws and operates in Dublin, Ireland. The goal of the website is to promote the company and to show the different attractions that the user could see when visiting Dublin. 

A live website can be found [here](xxx).
