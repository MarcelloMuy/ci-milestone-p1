# Rickshaw Guided Tours Project

## Introduction 
Welcome to my first milestone project. This project is a website for a fictinal guided tours company that uses rickshaws and operates in Dublin, Ireland. This website gives the user a way to know the brand and book the service. It also shows the different attractions that are available to see in Dublin.
